# Tweets-to-Stories-to-Topics
Potential for phase 4 project. First, scape Twitter data from people whose minds' I admire. Then, train GPT-2 on said Tweets using Google Colab. Next, generate short stories from Tweets (280 characters is a bit too short-from for my tastes... we could use a bit more attention). Finally, we'll topic model to explore our stories and prepare to feed as recommended reads.
