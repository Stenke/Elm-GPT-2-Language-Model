"Its even better on the 46th viewing (or so I hear)."
"1. Were here because we didnt follow sound recommendations around mask compliance and we opened too early (total horseshit Texas flex moves) 2. @GovAbbott and @LtGovTX are 100% accountable. And 3. HELL YES its political. Look at the states in crisis."

"The lack of courageous #COVID19 leadership in Texas is staggering. 1. To @GovAbbott + @LtGovTX - wheres the emergency plan based on science + data? Why cont to open? 2. To neighbors - please dont scoff at masks + distancing while saying you support health professionals"

"DeepTraffic is a deep RL competition anyone can participate in. If you do, you can now visualize your submission. Here's mine. Shortly after launch in 2017 I had a few minutes of glory in the top 5... And then the students found it. Try it out, it's easy:"
"A good way to understand an idea is to teach it. The student can be a human or a machine. For the former, they call you a professor. For the latter, they call you a programmer."
"24 years ago I immigrated to the United States: from a skinny Russian kid with a soccer ball to an American scientist at MIT. I'm proud of what this great nation stands for, from its founding to its tumultuous journey in becoming a symbol of freedom and innovation to the world."
"From our survey of @Tesla owners, the 5 most common reasons to disengage Autopilot: (1) need to exit highway, (2) stopping for traffic light, (3) construction zone, (4) lanes merge or split, (5) pedestrians or cyclists. If you own a Tesla, take the survey:"

"Science and technology has brought much development, and yet we still face many man-made problems. We are social animals. We depend on the community in which we live. Therefore, we need a sense of global responsibility, because the well-being of humanity is our own well-being."
"Reports of suffering are upsetting, but it's a mistake to think we can do nothing about it. Many problems we face are of our own making. Since we are social animals who need friends, the least we can do is smile and respond to others warm-heartedlythat will make a difference."
"The more people learn to tackle their afflictive emotions, the more individuals will achieve peace of mind, and the more individuals achieve inner peace, the greater are the prospects for peace in the world."

"HHDL sends his thanks for all the greetings he received on his birthday."

"Clarification and Context of Remarks Made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in a Recent BBC Interview"
"An effective means of teaching someone how to be more warm and compassionate is to use reasoning about the value and benefits of compassion, having them reflect on how they feel when someone is kind to them. This can prepare them to be warmer and more compassionate to others."
"Lets reflect on what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. We need to be positive. We weren't born to cause trouble or to do harm to others. For life to be of value, we must develop basic good human qualitieswarmth, kindness, compassion."
"Genuine friendship is not based on money and power, but on trust, which in turn develops as a result of showing concern for other peoples well-being. In other words, friendship is founded on warm-heartedness."
"Ideas may travel from the top down, but the movements that put them into effect have to work from the bottom up. I am encouraged to see young people trying to bring about positive change. Confident because their efforts are based on truth and reasontherefore they will succeed."
"If you set out to cheat and deceive others youll be tense and anxious in case youre found out. But if you live your life and conduct your business on the basis of truth and honesty, it gives you a sense of satisfaction and self-confidence that is also a source of inner strength"
"Advice for Children - HHDL explains the importance of warm-heartedness and intelligence in answer to a question from a young girl at his residence in Dharamsala, HP, India on June 10, 2019."
"Of the 7 billion human beings alive today, no one wants to suffer; no one chooses to have problems. Yet, many of the problems we face are our own creation. Why? Because of ignorance. But ignorance is not permanent and whether we overcome it depends on whether we make the effort."
"Compassion and concern for others are the key to human survival. People with no interest in religion sometimes disregard qualities like patience and compassion, which they associate with religious practice. In fact, they are relevant to anyone who wishes to live a happy life."
"Hope for Humanity - HHDL talks about how to counteract negative emotions by cultivating compassion in this short clip from a talk to Emory University students at his residence in Dharamsala, HP, India on May 31, 2019."
"How we view human nature can mean the difference between living in a world filled with people who are perceived as hostile, violent and dangerous, or as essentially kind, helpful and gentle. A deep awareness of the essential goodness of human beings can give us courage and hope."
"Our life depends on others so much that at the root of our existence is a fundamental need for love. That is why it is good to cultivate an authentic sense of responsibility and concern for the welfare of others."
"In our education system, we need to include lessons, like those concerning physical hygiene, that focus on mental and emotional hygiene, that teach how to develop a healthy mind. This is the core of what I call secular ethics."
"If you restrain from wrong-doing, people will see you as a friend and youll be happy. When people are powerful and wealthy, but dishonest, people dont like them, even if they dont show it to their faces. If you do good, youll have friends and when youre gone youll be missed"
"Honest concern for others is the key factor in improving our day to day lives. When you are warm-hearted, there is no room for anger, jealousy or insecurity. Healthy, happy families and a healthy peaceful nation are dependent on warm-heartedness."
"We need patience to protect our peace of mind, our compassionate mind. Patience is part of our defense, as is forgiveness. Enemies and troublemakers are helpful in that they give us the opportunity to exercise patience and forgiveness."
"Mental transformation takes time, but it becomes easier with familiarity. Dont entertain unrealistic expectations; it doesnt take place quickly. It requires patience and determination over months and years, but if you keep it up, at the end of your life youll be content."
"Our intelligence helps us regulate our emotions. Fear, for example, is based on mistrust and a lack of self-confidence. If, on the other hand, we remain honest and truthful, open and tolerant, we will have greater self-confidence and overcome fear."
"I am a bit skeptical about what we call blessings. I believe the ultimate source of blessings is within us. A good motivation and honesty bring self-confidence, which attracts the trust and respect of others. Therefore, the real source of blessings is in our own mind."
"The young people of this 21st century represent our planet now. They have the ability to bring about change. Even as climate change increases in intensity, they can work together in the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood to find and share solutions. They are our real hope."
"Because anger and hostility destroy our peace of mind, it is they that are our real enemy. Anger ruins our health; a compassionate attitude restores it. If it were basic human nature to be angry, thered be no hope, but since it is our nature to be compassionate, there is."
"Times always moving on; nothing can stop it. We cant change the past, but we can still learn from it. And we can shape the future, creating a more peaceful era, by adopting a realistic approach, recognising that the more compassionate you are, the more youll find inner peace."
"HHDL speaks to members of the Tibetan press on his release from the hospital in New Delhi, India on April 12, 2019. (Video courtesy VOA Tibetan Service)"
"Time is always moving on; nothing can stop it. We cant change the past, but we can shape the future. The more compassionate you are, the more you will find inner peace."
"From kindergarten onwards we need education to strengthen inner values not just pursue material goals. We need to introduce emotional hygiene, much as we teach physical hygiene. This way we can address the problems we face, in the hope of making this a century of non-violence."
"We have to learn how to use our time properly. It's important to make our lives meaningful. Bullying and cheating others may give a short-term return, but leaves a nagging sense of unease. Money doesn't yield real satisfaction, whereas compassion does."
"Any idea that concern for others, though a noble quality, is a matter for our private lives only, is simply short sighted. Compassion belongs to every sphere of activity, including, of course, the workplace."
"The ultimate source of a happy life is warmheartedness. Even animals display some sense of compassion. When it comes to human beings, compassion can be combined with intelligence. Through the application of reason, compassion can be extended to all 7 billion human beings."
"Cooperation comes from friendship, friendship comes from trust, and trust comes from kindheartedness. Once you have a genuine sense of concern for others, theres no room for cheating, bullying, or exploitation; instead, you can be honest, truthful and transparent in your conduct"
"In working for the good of humanity I don't think of myself just as a Tibetan or a Buddhist, but as a human being. We have to think of the whole of humanity. Being human is the common ground in our efforts to create a better world, because we all survive in dependence on others."
"We may sometimes feel that we cant do much as individuals, but humanity is made up of individuals; we can make a difference. As individuals we can influence our own families. Our families can influence our communities and our communities can influence our nations."
"Peace is not just the mere absence of violence or disturbance. It's when there is a possibility of conflict, but you deliberately avoid violence and adopt methods to solve the problem through peaceful means. That is real peace."
"Women have been shown to be more sensitive to others' suffering, whereas, warriors celebrated for killing their opponents are almost always men. We need to see more women in leadership roles and more closely involved in education about compassion. #InternationalWomensDay"
"When were under the sway of anger or attachment, were limited in our ability to take a full and realistic view of the situation. When the mind is compassionate, it is calm and were able to use our sense of reason practically, realistically, and with determination."
"The kind of behavior that really is spiritual practice consists of refraining from falsehood and abiding by the truth, neither humiliating nor mocking others, being humble, and having a good heart and helping others."
"HHDL on ""Why Leaders Should Be Mindful, Selfless, and Compassionate"" published in the Harvard Business Review on February 20th."
"We wont bring about peace in the world merely by praying for it; we have to take steps to tackle the violence and corruption that disrupt peace. We cant expect change if we dont take action."
"The source of a happy life is within us. Troublemakers in many parts of the world are often quite well-educated, so it is not just education that we need. What we need is to pay attention to inner values."
"I feel optimistic about the future because humanity seems to be growing more mature; scientists are paying more attention to our inner values, to the study of mind and the emotions. There is a clear desire for peace and concern for the environment."
"A sense of contentment is crucial to being happy. Physical health, material wealth and friends contribute to this, but contentment governs our relations with them all."
"How to Train Our Mind - HHDL explains how to train our mind to tackle destructive emotions in this short video clip from his meeting with a group from India at his residence in Dharamsala, HP, India on February 11, 2019."
"The first drawback of anger is that it destroys our inner peace; the second is that it distorts our view of reality. If we think about this and come to understand that anger is really unhelpful, that it is only destructive, we can begin to distance ourselves from anger."
"Spiritual practice involves, on the one hand, acting out of concern for others' well-being. On the other, it entails transforming ourselves so that we become more readily disposed to do so."
"It is very important to generate a good attitude, a good heart, as much as possible. From this, happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come."
"All the positive states of mind such as love, compassion, insight and so on, have the quality that you can enhance their capacity and increase their potential to a limitless degree, if you regularly practice them through training and by developing constant familiarity with them."
"We should practise by showing affection and helping one another. It is a mistake to pursue happiness and to seek to the avoid suffering by deceiving and humiliating other people. We must try to achieve happiness and eliminate suffering by being considerate and good-hearted."
"Our visit to this planet is short, so we should use our time meaningfully, which we can do by helping others wherever possible. And if we cannot help others, at least we should try not to create pain and suffering for them."
"True compassion isnt just an emotional response but a firm commitment founded on reason. Therefore, our compassion for others doesnt change even if they behave negatively. Our sense of responsibility for others gives rise to a wish to help them actively overcome their problems."
"Modern education is premised strongly on materialistic values. It is vital that when educating our childrens brains that we do not neglect to educate their hearts, a key element of which has to be the nurturing of our compassionate nature."
"Compassion is something really worthwhile. It is not just a religious or spiritual subject, not a matter of ideology. It is not a luxury, it is a necessity."
"A source of trouble is our unruly minds. We can counter that by developing a warm heart. We need to effect an inner transformation, to understand that love and affection are a real source of joy."
"If love is defined as a wish that others be happy and compassion as the wish that they be free from suffering, and you cultivate love and compassion within yourself, it will ensure happiness, good health and peace of mind."
"All things originate in the mind. Actions and events depend heavily on motivation. Appreciation of humanity, compassion and love are key points. If we develop a good heart, whether our field is science, agriculture or politics, since motivation is so crucial, theyll all improve."
"When you care for others, you manifest an inner strength despite any difficulties you face. Your own problems will seem less significant and bothersome to you. Reaching beyond your own problems and taking care of others, you gain confidence, courage and a greater sense of calm."
"Negative thoughts and emotions undermine the very causes of peace and happiness. In fact, when we think properly, it is totally illogical to seek happiness if we do nothing to restrain angry, spiteful, and malicious thoughts and emotions."
"Its good to remember that other human beings are like us. We are born the same way; we die the same way. While were alive its better to be able to trust each other as friends. We earn other peoples trust when we show a genuine concern for their well-being."
"Love, kindness, compassion and tolerance are qualities common to all the great religions, and whether or not we follow any particular religious tradition, the benefits of love and kindness are obvious to anyone."
"For some people the idea of compassion entails a complete disregard for or even a sacrifice of their own interests. This is not the case. In fact, we first of all have to have a wish to be happy ourselves if we dont love ourselves like that, how can we love others?"
"""Climate change is not the concern of just one or two nations. It is an issue that affects the whole of humanity and every living being on this earth."" (From HHDL's Message to Delegates to the COP24 UN Climate Conference )"
"Everybody appreciates kindness, but unfortunately our modern education system, with its materialistic goals, doesnt have much room for inner values. We need to make people more aware of such inner values on the basis of scientific findings, common sense and common experience."
"We need friends and friendship is based on trust. To earn trust, money and power arent enough; you have to show some concern for others. You cant buy trust in the supermarket."
"Even more important than the warmth and affection we receive, is the warmth and affection we give. It is by giving warmth and affection, by having a genuine sense of concern for others, in other words through compassion, that we gain the conditions for genuine happiness."
"Human beings are social animals. What brings us together is love and affectionanger drives us apart. Just as we employ physical hygiene to protect our health, we need emotional hygiene, the means to tackle our destructive emotions, if we are to achieve peace of mind."
"We all want to live a happy life, so we have to learn to live together in trust and mutual respect. We do have differences of race, nationality, religious faith and so on, but these differences are secondary in comparison to our equality in being human."
"The quality of what we do depends on our motivation, which is why we have to learn how to cultivate a compassionate mind."
"Anger can be reduced if we work to cultivate love and affection. However, we first have to come to terms with whatever benefits or disadvantages anger may bring. Primarily, anger destroys our peace of mind; loving-kindness earns us friends and eliminates the risk of being alone."
"Be honest, truthful, and altruistic. If you concern yourself with taking care of others, therell be no room for lies, bullying and cheating. If youre truthful you can live transparently, which will enable you to establish trust, the basis for making friends."
"We need to be determined to achieve positive change, and also be able to take a long view of what needs to be done. What is important is not to become demoralized. Optimism leads to success; pessimism leads to defeat. One person can be the source of inspiration for many others."
"Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation, but what needs to be acknowledged is that that energy is blind. It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view."
"I dont think of myself just as a Tibetan or a Buddhist, but as a human being. We have to think of the whole of humanity. Being human is the common ground in our efforts to create a better world. Remember, we all survive in dependence on others."
"Because motivation pervades all action, it is important that we have a positive motivation. Whatever we are involved in, whether it's politics, education, medicine, law, engineering, science, business or industry, the nature of our motivation determines the character of our work."
"As social animals we need friends, but we make friends on the basis of trust, which comes about as a result of affection and concern for others. You cant buy trust or acquire it by use of force. Its source is warm-heartedness."
"A Healthy Mind for a Healthy Body - HHDL speaks about the importance of peace of mind at his residence in Dharamsala, HP, India on October 17, 2018."
"The creation of a more peaceful and happier society has to begin from the level of the individual, and from there it can expand to one's family, to one's neighborhood, to one's community and so on."
"Kindness and a good heart are the foundation for success in this life, progress on the spiritual path, and the fulfillment of our aspirations. Our need for them is not limited to any specific time, place, society, or culture."
"Anger and fear undermine our immune system, while warm-heartedness brings peace of mind. Therefore, just as we teach children to comply with physical hygiene for the good of their health, we should also counsel them in a kind of hygiene of the emotions."
"In our quest for happiness and the avoidance of suffering, we are all fundamentally the same, and therefore equal. Despite all the characteristics that differentiate us - race, language, religion, gender, wealth and many others - we are all equal in terms of our basic humanity."
"We seek happiness in external things without realizing that they dont help when we have problems within. We need to focus instead on the joy that comes with peace of mind that allows us to remain happy whatever happens."
"For many people, the only tangible value is money. And of course money has its place, but the value of cultivating a compassionate attitude is much more effective. When we only pay attention to material values, theres little room for concern for others, or for mutual regard."
"Leaving aside the perspective of spiritual practice, even in worldly terms, in terms of our enjoying a happy day-to-day existence, the calmer our minds are, the greater our peace of mind will be and the greater will be our ability to enjoy a happy and joyful life."
"Problems will always arise, but we need to address them differently. We need to engage in dialogue to resolve them rather than resorting to the use of force. #PeaceDayChallenge"
"We are intelligent, we have seed of compassion from birth. Using reason and intelligence we can enhance our sense of compassion and come to understand how its opposite, anger, is harmful."
"HHDL looking at Tilly Lockey's prosthetic hands during the discussion on Robotics and Telepresence at De Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, Netherlands on September 15, 2018. (Photo by Olivier Adam)"
"In the present circumstances, no one can afford to assume that someone else will solve their problems. Each one of us has a responsibility to help guide our global family in the right direction. Good wishes are not sufficient; we must become actively engaged."
"A sense of contentment is crucial to being happy. Physical health, material wealth and friends contribute to this, but contentment governs our relations with them all."
"In our modern society everything seems geared to material development, even our systems of education. As a result we no longer pay sufficient attention to our inner values, which leads to mental unrest. In order to address this imbalance we need to pay more attention to our minds"
"If we were really to see one another as brothers and sisters, there would be no basis for division, cheating and exploitation among us. Therefore its important to promote the idea of the oneness of humanity, that in being human we are all the same."
"The first of my personal commitments is to work to increase human happiness by encouraging the cultivation of inner values and a sense of concern for others well being. These are the key factors whether one is a religious person or not."
"Since we desire the true happiness that is brought about by a calm mind, and such peace of mind arises only from having a compassionate attitude, we need to make a concerted effort to develop compassion."
"As a human being Im aware that we are all physically, mentally and emotionally the same and we all want to live a happy life. Scientists say our basic nature is compassionate. Its clear that love and affection bring people together."
"Irrespective of whether we have faith in religion or not, its good to be more compassionate. It makes us happier as individuals with a positive influence on our families and the neighborhood where we live."
"I am one of the 7 billion human beings alive today. We each have a responsibility to think about humanity and the good of the world because it affects our own future. We werent born on this planet at this time to create problems but to bring about some benefit."
"We can achieve peace of mind if we tackle our destructive emotions, so the goal of making the 21st century an era of peace and compassion is feasible. It will involve finding solutions to problems in dialogue, not the use of force."
"We may say prayers when we are trying to solve the problems we face, but it is up to us to put an end to violence and bring about peace. Creating peace is our responsibility. To pray for peace while still engaging in the causes that give rise to violence is contradictory."
"Human beings are social animals and it is love that brings us together, while anger drives us apart. To live more peacefully and joyfully in our day to day lives, we need a warm heart."
"Making others happy is not a question of sacrificing our own happiness. Trying to make others happy, even when we do not always succeed, is a source of great satisfaction. Anger and hatred are signs of weakness, while compassion is a sure sign of strength."
"Many of the problems we face today are our own creation. Creating a more peaceful world requires a peaceful mind and a peaceful heart. As human brothers and sisters we must live together in tolerance and affection."
"As human beings we need to assess whether anger has any value - it destroys our peace of mind. Compassion, on the other hand, brings optimism and hope."
"The kind of behavior that really is spiritual practice consists of refraining from falsehood and abiding by the truth, neither humiliating nor mocking others, being humble, and having a good heart and helping others."
"When our intentions toward others are good, we find that any feelings of anxiety or insecurity we may have are greatly reduced. We experience a liberation from our habitual preoccupation with self and paradoxically, this gives rise to strong feelings of confidence."
"Inner transformation is not a matter of faith or prayer. It involves reason and the use of human intelligence. A calm and healthy mind has a very positive effect on our physical health and well-being."
"Ethics are not a collection of commandments and prohibitions to abide by, but a natural inner offering that can bring happiness and satisfaction to ourselves and others."
"Virtually all of us have benefited from our mothers affection at the start of our lives. When someone is on their deathbed, if he or she is surrounded by loved ones they can pass away peacefully. From birth to death we all need affection."

"HHDL speaks on how to achieve long lasting happiness in this short clip from his talk at the launch of the Happiness Curriculum in Delhi Government Schools in New Delhi, India on July 2, 2018."
"While many people consider sensory experience as the main source of happiness, really it is peace of mind. What destroys peace of mind is anger, hatred, anxiety and fear. Kindness counters thisand through appropriate education we can learn to tackle such emotions."
"Cultivating a close, warm-hearted feeling for others automatically puts the mind at ease. It helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacles we encounter. It is the ultimate source of success in life."
"I am one of the 7 billion human beings alive today. We each have a responsibility to think about humanity and the good of the world because it affects our own future. We werent born on this planet at this time to create problems but to bring about some benefit."
"If you develop a pure and sincere motivation, if you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness, compassion, and respect, then you can carry on any kind of work, in any field, and function more effectively."
"Prayer by itself is not sufficient to bring about peace of mind. What is much more effective is coming to understand the workings of the mind and learning how to tackle the mental afflictions that disturb it."
"I always consider that the shape of the future is in our hands. The past is past and cant be changed, but the future has not yet arrived. Young people have the opportunity and responsibility to shape it by creating a better world."
"We may say prayers when we are trying to solve the problems we face, but it is up to us to put an end to violence and bring about peace. Creating peace is our responsibility. To pray for peace while still engaging in the causes that give rise to violence is contradictory."
"In todays interconnected and globalized world, its now commonplace for people of different world views, faiths and races to live side by side. Its a matter of great urgency, therefore, that we find ways to cooperate with one another in a spirit of mutual acceptance and respect"
"The world belongs to its 7 billion inhabitants. In the past, communities could flourish in isolation, but now we cant. This World Environment Day lets remember that we depend on each other and that to meet the challenge of climate change, we have to work together."
"Some people consider the practice of love and compassion is only related to religious practice and if they are not interested in religion they neglect these inner values. But love and compassion are qualities that human beings require just to live together."
"Because of our intelligence we human beings are uniquely capable not only of creating problems, but of doing so on a large scale. Therefore, it is important that we use our intelligence in constructive ways. Thats what warm-heartedness and concern for others lead us to do."
"Everyone wants to lead a peaceful, happy life, but happiness and success arent measured by how much money you have, but by whether you have inner peace in your heart."
"Im Tibetan, Im Buddhist and Im the Dalai Lama, but if I emphasize these differences it sets me apart and raises barriers with other people. What we need to do is to pay more attention to the ways in which we are the same as other people."
"People inflict pain on others in their selfish pursuit of happiness and satisfaction. Yet true happiness comes from a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood. We need to cultivate a sense of universal responsibility for one another and the planet we share."
"Compassion is of little value if it just remains an idea. It must motivate how we respond to others and be reflected in all our thoughts and actions."
"We are, you might say, ""brainwashed"" into thinking that money is the source of happiness while what we really need to know is that inner peace is something that comes from within."
"Announcing the release of the official Dalai Lama app for Android now available for download at . Get official news, videos, and photos of HHDL, including live video streams when they are available. Also available for iPhone at"

"Scientists warn that constant fear and anger are bad for our health, while being compassionate and warm-hearted contributes to our physical and mental well-being. Therefore, just as we observe physical hygiene to stay well, we need to cultivate a kind of emotional hygiene too."
"Former Captain of the Indian National Cricket Team Sachin Tendulkar and HHDL enjoy meeting each other at the latters residence in Dharamsala, India on May 3, 2018. (Photo by Tenzin Choejor)"
"There is a link between our physical and verbal actions and emotions. If, instead of anger, hatred and suspicion, we are moved by loving-kindness, we will naturally have greater respect for others and our actions will be non-violent."
"There are always problems to face, but it makes a difference if our minds are calm. On the surface we may get upset, but it makes a difference if we are able to stay calm in the depths of our minds."
"HHDL's advice to graduating students during the Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management Convocation ceremony in New Delhi, India on April 23, 2018."
"Humanity's thirst for natural resources can only be sustained if we adapt our patterns of consumption. Competition for necessities like water, food and land will inevitably intensify. To meet the challenge of climate change and environmental depletion we must all cooperate."
"Not only is it the case that happy people are more willing to help others, but as I generally point out, helping others is the best way to help yourself, the best way to promote your own happiness. It is you, yourself, who will receive the benefit."
"Compassion reduces our fear, boosts our confidence, and opens us to inner strength. By reducing distrust, it opens us to others and brings us a sense of connections with them and a sense of purpose and meaning in life."
"I feel that its crucial to have a clear recognition of the value of your objective. That's the important thing. Recognizing that your objective is worthy, because it involves others' welfare or the general well-being of the community, gives you the determination to pursue it."
"HHDL speaks to students on ""Death as a Part of Life"", how living a meaningful life leads to no regrets at the time of death, during their meeting at his residence in Dharamsala, India on April 2, 2018."
"In the modern world, where the pursuit of money is considered more important than the cultivation of inner values a fresh approach is required to incorporate secular ethics or universal values into the system of education."
"Our real enemies and the enemies of humanity are negative emotions like anger and hatred. Indeed, people who are dominated by powerful negative emotions should be objects of our compassion."
"Change in the world comes from individuals, from the inner peace in individual hearts. Just as ripples spread out when a single pebble is dropped into water, the actions of individuals can have far-reaching effects."
"In our day to day life warm-heartedness is the key factor for happiness."
"World peace can only be based on inner peace. If we ask what destroys our inner peace, it's not weapons and external threats, but our own inner flaws like anger. This is one of the reasons why love and compassion are important, because they strengthen us. This is a source of hope"
"The many factors which divide us are actually much more superficial than those we share. Despite all of the things that differentiate us race, language, religion, gender, wealth and so on we are all equal concerning our fundamental humanity."
"When each of us learns to appreciate the critical importance of ethics and makes inner values like compassion and patience an integral part of our basic outlook on life, the effects will be far-reaching."
"In todays materialistic world there is a risk of people becoming slaves to money, as though they were simply cogs in a huge money-making machine. This does nothing for human dignity, freedom, and genuine well-being. Wealth should serve humanity, and not the other way around."

"Peace has a great deal to do with warm-heartedness and respect for the lives of others, avoiding doing them harm and regarding their lives as being as precious as our own. If, on that basis, we can also be of help to others, so much the better."
"Insofar as the destructive effects of anger and hateful thoughts are concerned, one cannot get protection from wealth nor education. The only factor that can give protection from the destructive effects of anger and hatred is the practice of tolerance and patience."
"Because of the great differences in our ways of thinking, it is inevitable that we have different religions and faiths. Each has its own beauty. And it is much better that we live together on the basis of mutual respect and mutual admiration."
"Practicing compassion, caring for others and sharing their problems, lays the foundation for a meaningful life, not only at the level of the individual, family or community, but also for humanity as a whole."
"The very purpose of spirituality is self-discipline. Rather than criticizing others, we should evaluate and criticize ourselves. Ask yourself, what am I doing about my anger, my attachment, my pride, my jealousy? These are the things we should check in our day to day lives."
"Genuine friends, are attracted by a warm heart, not money, not power. A genuine friend considers you as just another human being, as a brother or sister, and shows affection on that level, regardless of whether you are rich or poor, or in a high position; that is a genuine friend"
"Compassion suits our physical condition, whereas anger, fear and distrust are harmful to our well-being. Therefore, just as we learn the importance of physical hygiene to physical health, to ensure healthy minds, we need to learn some kind of emotional hygiene."
"Although I am a Buddhist monk, I am skeptical that prayers alone will achieve world peace. We need instead to be enthusiastic and self-confident in taking action."
"I believe the ultimate source of blessings is within us. A good motivation and honesty bring self-confidence, which attracts the trust and respect of others. Therefore the real source of blessings is in our own mind."
"The basic foundation of humanity is compassion and love. This is why, if even a few individuals simply try to create mental peace and happiness within themselves and act responsibly and kind-heartedly towards others, they will have a positive influence in their community."
"Many people think that patience is a sign of weakness. I think this is a mistake. It is anger that is a sign of weakness, whereas patience is a sign of strength."
